A description of the experiments in the Data-Driven Positive paper

`sys_3_2_cont.m` A continuous-time stabilization experiment with 3 states and 2 inputs.

`sys_3_1_discrete.m` A discrete-time stabilization experiment with 3 states and 1 input.

`sys_5_3_discrete.m` A discrete-time stabilization experiment with 5 states and 3 inputs.

`sys_5_3_discrete_signpattern.m` A discrete-time stabilization experiment with 5 states and 3 inputs, where the controller K must obey sign pattern constraints.
